# MSc-Ethics

This is all the relevant coding that accompanies the work done for my MSc in AI.

Week 1\
Descriptive work on ideas surrounding Responsible AI with a focus on what XAI is and why it is important.
No coding this week.

Week 2\
Introduce the concept of explainable AI and its importance in the context of Responsible AI.
Cover various explainability techniques to use with machine learning and deep learning.
